For testing our project:

Our web app doesn’t work with just any email address right now, so we created a test account for you to use to access the web app and test its functions.

Steps to access the web app:

1. Go to: https://musu-ypu7.onrender.com
2. Log in to Spotify using the test account:
Email: test3583test@gmail.com
Password: test35833583
3. If Spotify asks for a verification code sent to the email, go to gmail.com and log in with:
Email: test3583test@gmail.com
Password: test3583
4. Retrieve the code from the email and enter it in the web app where prompted.

After this, you should have full access to test the project.
